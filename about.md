An old dad trying to learn new tricks.
I live in the mountains of Puerto Rico with my wife, our 4-year old son and 1-year-old daughter.
My 22-year old step son lives in the apartment downstairs with his partner and their 2-year-old daughter.

I've worked most of my life in not-for-profits helping working people build power through collective action.
My computer journey started just a few years ago, when I had to create a membership database for our organization. 
That led me to Airtable, which led me to excel's power query, which lead me to SQL and then on to python for data collection and analysis.
